This mobile game project was one of my first major Unity projects, developed during 2021-2022. While the code might not reflect my current standards, it demonstrates my early problem-solving skills. 
If I were to work on this project now, I would take a completely different approach to most of the scripts, reflecting how much Iâ€™ve grown as a developer since then.
